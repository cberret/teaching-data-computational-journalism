## Steps Toward Bringing Data and Computation into Your Journalism School

### Faculty Development and Recruitment

For many journalism schools, integrating specialized coursework in data and computation will present something of a chicken-and-egg conundrum. There is professional demand for data journalists in part because they are relatively scarce, so while schools may wish to prepare their graduates for this emerging field, the field itself may not yet have enough teachers in its ranks.

But specialized coursework will meet only some of the need highlighted in this study: data and computation must also continue to be integrated into many classes where it is now neglected, from boot camps to capstones and theses. It is worth recalling that editors once resisted the use of photography as a journalistic tool. Journalism schools must prepare students to bring data and computation to any story that needs it.

This may require many journalism faculty to be trained to work with data and computational tools. At the very least, journalism instructors should be conscious of when a student’s work may benefit from data, even if the student must go elsewhere for targeted instruction. Scheduling guest lectures may also serve as a transitional solution.

### Trainings or Modules

In 2014, NICAR introduced data journalism exercises for academics interested in teaching data journalism but in need of a little help. These promise to be useful to journalism instructors who would like to teach data.

The benefit of NICAR and other journalism training organizations could go well beyond the modules, though. New tools are developing quickly, and it is critical for faculty to continue to grow, learn, and change as the field itself develops.

In fact, NICAR filled a vacuum that existed because many academic institutions didn’t address new tools or skills. Meanwhile, personal computing tools became more powerful, digital information sources became more commonplace, and news organizations increasingly relied on digital methods of gathering and distributing news. Just as print newspapers were slow to recognize the power of data-driven reporting and the Internet, so too have journalism schools been reluctant to change. Teaching institutions must adapt or risk being unable to fulfill their goals and mission, both to their students and to the profession.

### Incoming Skills, Technical Literacies, and Boot Camps

Many graduate programs in journalism readily enroll students with little to no prior experience as reporters. There is an implicit assumption that their undergraduate work will provide a foundation to begin learning to think like a reporter and produce stories in a variety of platforms.

With data and computational journalism, though, there may be more substantial gaps to bridge in terms of math skills and technical literacies. Oftentimes, students must learn to use a variety of unfamiliar software in order to even begin working with data, statistics, and programming languages. As it stands, it should be fairly straightforward to teach the average journalism student to think about data, to find stories in a spreadsheet, and even to think critically about the numbers. Reporters have always needed to see inside complicated issues and to ask tough questions in order to get the story right.

Math and tech skills may require extra time. This skill gap could be ameliorated with a summer boot camp that focuses largely on building skills, tools, and technical literacies, while deferring instruction in reporting until the regular term begins. This way, when students enter their regular master’s coursework, they will be equipped with some fluency in the data and computational tools that they will use as concentrators.

In the case that data concentrators go through an extended boot camp, it may be appropriate for their fall introduction to data journalism class to be separate and more advanced than the data journalism course that is required of all students. For an example of how this coursework could be structured, we have listed the offerings of Columbia’s Lede Program in the appendix.

### Technology Infrastructure

Many colleges and universities provide computer labs and studios for classes. The primary advantage is the certainty that each student will have a workstation with the necessary technical specifications and software installed. The primary disadvantage is that students may graduate without the tools they need to practice the skills they have learned.

Although their newsroom workstation could potentially be outfitted with the tools they need, if any of those students became freelancers, they may be out of luck if they left class without bringing along them the tools they learned in school.

Providing server space for students is a great way to begin teaching them the Unix command line and to provide resources for data-intensive projects. But several institutional concerns arise. Schools are required by law to maintain the confidentiality of student data, and so the security of student servers may become a concern. Students might instead begin by working on virtual machines using a program such as the free, cross-platform VirtualBox in order to become acquainted with running a machine from the command line.

### Benefits of Distance or Online Learning

Using MOOCs in complementary fashion with data journalism courses could help professors integrate new skills into what they offer, said Doig from ASU.

In addition, distance learning and virtual classrooms may provide structure and support that MOOCs lack. Journalism schools may consider coordinating partnerships in which students cross-enroll in specialized coursework and take the class over a video stream. The student would participate in class, submit work, and receive credit like any other student. This approach could fill coursework gaps in cases where it is otherwise difficult to find an instructor.

Stanton, the founder of ForJournalism.com, offers a cautionary word: maintaining online courses is a problem for any program that produces tutorials or screencasts. Without updating, the value of the offerings diminishes quickly, Stanton said. The ForJournalism.com tutorial on building a web framework with Django is based on an older version of the open source software, for example.

Stanton suggests that universities create a consortium of universities where each participating university would take ownership of specific topics in which it had expert faculty. It would create labs to provide the technical instruction in those areas and offer screencast tutorials on the basics. Then each school could build on that foundational learning in projects specific to their programs.

### Fostering Collaboration

Journalism schools should build collaborative partnerships with other disciplines. Many professional schools, journalism included, have tended to operate as silos within universities because they draw their culture and concerns from a field of practice rather than a tradition of academic discourse. That stance must shift because journalism itself is shifting. As a result, we should recognize that journalism is not a narrow set of traditional newsroom skills, but instead encompasses whatever tools and methods have, in one way or another, been made journalistic. Practitioners of data-driven and computational journalism have thrived by embracing interdisciplinarity in their work. Several journalism schools have begun to build bridges with computer science departments by opening research centers, co-teaching and cross-listing classes, and even developing joint degree programs. This is a promising start. Not only will journalism schools benefit from acting as leaders in interdisciplinary collaboration, but they also should be naturally suited to this role as a field situated at the intersection of many other disciplines.

### Note on Specialist Faculty in Data and Computation

An integrated data journalism curriculum presents a unique challenge. In the state of the field as it has developed and exists today, data journalism is usually a lone course, or element of a course, taught by one specialist instructor. Often, the instructor is a professional journalist working as an adjunct more for the love of spreading the word than for the money. To achieve a fully integrated curriculum, the overall faculty at journalism programs would need to commit to change, and administrations would need to foster training for faculty. The change needs to be broad. There should not be a single faculty member juggling all the classes in data and computational skills, nor should guest lectures from that faculty member suffice in broadening the class to account for data. Journalism schools must commit to the idea that they cannot train information professionals to work in an increasingly complicated world of information without developing these crucial literacies. It must be integrated across the board.
