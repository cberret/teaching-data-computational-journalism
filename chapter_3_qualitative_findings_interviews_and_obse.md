# Chapter 3: Qualitative Findings: Interviews and Observations


Identifying What to Teach

“Data journalism isn’t easy to define or to teach. It is constantly changing and best practices are evolving. One needs to learn a lot by doing, too.” – Jonah Newman of the Chicago Reporter

Our interviews echoed many of the findings in our quantitative data, so rather than repeat those findings, this chapter focuses on how the professors put the concepts into practice in the classroom. It is intended to provide a roadmap of existing pedagogical work in data journalism and offer insights into common challenges.

We interviewed nearly 50 teachers and practitioners, and while there is a diversity of thought, there also is a consensus when it comes to the foundations of data journalism curricula: critical thinking, mastery of key data skills, and teaching programming concepts so that students will be able to learn new tools as needed.

David Boardman, dean of Temple University’s School of Media and Communication, suggested that data journalism is about learning higher and more complex levels of analysis. This includes learning more sophisticated tools and software and almost certainly some level of programming.

In a data journalism class, having that critical thinking skill means that the students learn to treat data in an ethical way, so that rather than bending the data to represent a particular view, the goal is toward truth and accuracy.

“I would always err on the [teaching of] critical thinking skills,” said LaFleur of the Center for Investigative Reporting. “That is the harder skill to ingrain in people. You can learn how to click things and write a line of code.”

In general, those who teach data journalism focus on hands-on methods. In the beginning, the professors will provide data to students to analyze. LaFleur, for example, uses hands-on training with one data set and then will introduce a similar data set and assign the students to ask the same types of questions, but on their own.

By the middle of a course, students often have to obtain their own data, submitting public records requests. The students then move on to data that require more complex analysis. By doing this, the professors are doing two key things: teaching the critical thinking that goes with negotiating for information and understanding the bounds of that information. At the same time, the students are using basic tools to accomplish their goals, be they spreadsheets or a relational database. In some classes, the focus is on writing a memo by the end of the course on a possible story. In other courses, the professors expect the students to report and write a story. This last step—either a memo or a story—once again helps the student use critical thinking, this time pairing that with the skills of storytelling.

The key is learning how to obtain mastery, said Ira Chinoy, an associate professor at the University of Maryland who previously led the data journalism efforts at the Washington Post.

Chinoy relates this to the 2009 “Miracle on the Hudson” and how the pilot used reflexive mastery to land the US Airways plane on the river after bird strikes caused both engines to fail. In class, when students get discouraged about bad interactions or conversations in pursuit of their databases, Chinoy brings up “Sully” Sullenberger’s actions and says, “Do you think he could have done that on his first day of pilot school?”

Chinoy emphasized that the information should not always be presented to the students up front. He likes to give them a chance to come up against obstacles. They also need to develop a sense of when data could be problematic, what are signs of that, and what is each student’s best practice for examining the data.

The Coding Issue

Whether data journalists need to program remains an active debate. But when we delved into this issue, we found that we first need to define what we mean in terms of data journalism. To some, “code” means web development and design—back to the concept of HTML and CSS. “Programming” means writing programs that enable advanced mining of data or algorithms that could identify patterns.

The bottom line is that to do more advanced data journalism, its practitioners need, at a minimum, to understand how programming works. This could be considered the start of computational thinking. Just scraping information from the Web can involve simple programming using Python, and understanding what is possible with programmatic solutions is critical for journalists looking at websites and other troves of information, much of which is not just in rows and columns.

As students develop the ability to recognize computational solutions to some of these problems, some of them may then learn how to program. But even those who don’t take the coding path should still be able to understand how solutions like these can be a part of their journalistic practice. The ability to work with data and think in terms of computation is a skill broader and more necessary than any specific tool or programming language. It is vital that we don’t confuse the two.

Mark Hansen, a professor of journalism at Columbia and director of its Brown Institute for Media Innovation, also focuses on teaching both programming skills and the mindset of computational journalism. The idea, according to Hansen, is that by using programming, journalists can think beyond rows and columns as they search for answers in data of all forms, whether structured or unstructured.

Nicholas Diakopoulos, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland, has been teaching a number of classes in data journalism beyond the introductory level. And he also provides a course on coding in the sophomore year. His aim, he said, is to move the undergraduate students from the track of learning CSS/HTML basic web skills to understanding web development and news apps. Beyond that, he’s offering a class on computational journalism with a focus on Python, text analysis and aggregation, recommender systems, and writing stories with code behind it.

Diakopoulos suggested that students could also take computer science classes if they want to learn how to be hackers—meaning, in the original sense of the word, anyone fluent enough with computers to use them creatively.

It’s all about working with data in a principled way, Diakopoulos said. He ties this to CAR and Philip Meyer’s crusade to bring the scientific way of thinking into journalism 50 years earlier; in other words, thinking methodically, thinking about how to frame an experiment, gather data, and use rigorous methods to build evidence of some finding of journalistic importance.

In the end, data journalism is about teaching how to find the story, using an increasing array of data techniques, said David Donald, data journalist in residence at the School of Communication at American University and data director of AU’s Investigative Reporting Workshop. “You’re still talking about story and how data needs to be vetted and be expressed in a way that gets into the public’s brain easily,” Donald said. “From the investigative side, you are looking for evidence in the data.”

Developing that computational ability will become even more important to handle the vast amounts of data in today’s world. More tools will come and go, but data journalism, at its core, will enable journalists to do their job in a more expansive way, said Coll of Columbia.

“I think that [data journalism] will be around for a while” Coll said. “It will be around for a whole set of iterations of platforms and distribution systems, and even media. So we get virtual reality, or we get 3D, or we don’t. That’s a whole different set of questions. This is going to be about how you report on government, how you report on corporations, how you tell wheat from chaff.”

Data journalists are starting to address this type of coverage, but it takes a deeper level of data journalism capability—the computational journalism slice of data journalism. Some of it involves presenting data in new, journalistic ways. The “Surgeon Scorecard,” published by ProPublica, is one example. ProPublica used extensive Medicare data and collaborated with leaders in the field to evaluate the performance of surgeons.

In other iterations, this level of computational journalism means examining information in new, more complex ways. Examples of that type of data journalism are the Wall Street Journal’s coverage of the Medicare system, which received the 2015 Pulitzer Prize in Investigative Reporting, and Reuters’ 2014 project examining influence in the Supreme Court.

Institutional Challenges: Resources

Depending on the university, some students need more support with technology. Some students still do not own personal laptops and rely on school computer labs for their assignments, for example. Other students may be using personal computing devices that are not equipped with what they need to do data journalism. Students who use a tablet (such as an iPad) as their primary tool will face barriers.

Meredith Broussard, who taught data journalism at Temple University until 2015, said that ensuring that her students had the equipment they needed for her class was a major priority. Many of her students relied on a tablet, which meant equipping computer labs with the necessary equipment and platforms—or even lending laptops to students for the term.

Brant Houston of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign also pointed to the availability of resources as an important issue—especially for universities that draw students from economically disadvantaged populations.

Journalism schools can help these students by investing in up-to-date lab equipment and by working to create an environment that makes it easy for students to access needed software and to install it on their own devices. Journalism school administrators should consider more frequent audits and surveys of professors to identify which software will be most useful for their students.

And for students who are working on their own personal laptops, some professors hold provisioning sessions to help students install the needed software at the beginning of the term.

Institutional Challenges: Faculty Expertise

There is no secret that a divide exists between the professional journalism world and the academic world. This chasm continues even with faculty when it comes to who teaches data journalism and the impact it will have on the department.

Of course, each brand of data journalism instructor may have his or her own biases. Those who started as professional journalists, or who still work in a newsroom and teach as an adjunct, believe that they can convey the critical thinking skills needed to succeed in a newsroom environment more effectively than a professor whose experience is in research.

On the other hand, Diakopoulos of the University of Maryland believes that faculty should hold PhDs, and that while it would be good to be able to hire someone with 25 years of experience in data journalism, it’s an unrealistic expectation at this stage of the field’s development. His goal, he said, is to teach thinking through research. Still, he admitted that this is a struggle.

Some data journalists and journalism professors take issue with Diakopoulos, suggesting that such a model of data journalism professors with PhDs is unrealistic in a world where data journalism emerged from the professional practice, not academia.

Wherever journalism schools find the necessary faculty, just hiring a new professor to specialize in data journalism will not solve the problem, said Doig from ASU. “One difficulty with having somebody like me is everybody else can say, ‘Ah, we don’t have to worry about data journalism now.’ In reality, I teach maybe two sections of 20 students each semester. That’s a fraction of our total student load,” Doig said. “So believing that it is somehow being taken care of by one specialist like that, that isn’t the case.”

To help solve at least some of the issues, Doig has provided short video tutorials to other professors for basic government reporting classes.

While Doig believes it would be good to have a required data journalism course, he also questions whether that is possible. “How are you going to find the faculty to teach that?” he asked. “There’s not enough people in town who could teach that.”

Professional track and academic track faculty members agree that for now, pulling in professional journalists to serve as adjuncts will continue to be necessary and that relying on professional journalists alone will not solve the problem.

For Dustin Harp at the University of Texas, Arlington, this conundrum was solved through her own initiative. She had never taught data journalism but decided the students needed the class, so she did some research and created one. Some colleagues asked her why. She has tenure and no one asked her to take on the extra work. But the students needed the class, Harp said. She used lynda.com for tutorials and learned the same information before teaching her students.

“The thing is I’m a qualitative researcher, I’m not a numbers person, I’m not a numbers cruncher, so it was very crazy and daunting. After I said I was going to do it, it was on the schedule, I was like what have I gotten myself into?” Harp said. “But I follow the field. . . . I’m aware that data journalism is, it’s a tool our students need to be more competitive to get jobs.”

Institutional Challenges: Student Engagement

Journalism programs need to do a better job of persuading or even requiring students to take a data journalism class. Students may shy away because they believe they aren’t any good at math. “A lot of students are scared of ‘that math thing,’” said one journalism student at Northwestern University.

Resistance to math is an issue far broader than the field of journalism, but it will need to be addressed if teaching data journalism is to be taken seriously. This applies to both teachers and students, some of whom may have chosen to pursue journalism in part because they thought that it would require little or no math.

The problems go deeper than just convincing people they can handle math. Even in universities with entire programs focused on teaching programming, data journalism, and even data visualization, some students have reported that it wasn’t easy to find out about these opportunities. Some of the reasons have to do with silos within schools and departments for specific programs as well as specific tracks with emphasis on specific types of journalistic practice.

Rich Gordon, co-founder of the Knight Lab and director of digital innovation at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, agrees that a gap exists between the basic CAR course and the much more advanced program through Knight Lab, which brings in technologists and works with the technologists to develop new applications for journalism. Journalism students going through a normal degree plan may have the opportunity to take a basic CAR class, but most won’t ever be exposed to the work at the lab, he said.

In general, data journalism courses are electives and draw only a few students out of the total enrolled in each journalism program. Some of that has to do with capacity, but another issue is the lack of visibility. Often, other professors don’t treat the classes as vital to a journalism career.

“There’s some student interest in CAR,” said one University of Missouri journalism graduate. “But there would be more if it were expressed as an option for students early on.”

Universities can address this issue, said Mike Reilley, professor of practice at Arizona State University, who regards universities as “‘too siloed.” Reilley advocates team-taught courses and cooperation between departments.

Some students work their way through to find what they need. For instance, one student who took Temple University’s undergraduate class in data journalism had taken classes in programming with Python through the university’s business school. She told our researchers she planned on learning more data journalism as she wanted to continue doing this type of journalism when she graduated. But institutional changes could make data journalism much more accessible.

Several students suggested that schools should offer a track that could include a journalistically focused statistics class, a class that focuses on databases, a class with a focus on reporting with data, and others that delve into more in-depth data reporting and data visualization.

One of the authors of this report co-taught a spring 2015 watchdog reporting class with an engineering professor. Five computer science students embedded into project teams of journalism students. The journalism students learned new data skills, and the computer science students learned techniques in reporting and writing. The class offered challenges, too. Next time around, there may be a more defined way for the journalism students to take on data challenges of their own and continued emphasis on having the computer science students learn skills such as interviewing.
