# Chapter 2: State of the Field: Our Quantitative Data


## The Scope of Our Study

For this report, we collected and analyzed information on 113 journalism schools, roughly one-quarter of the nation’s journalism programs, and gathered 63 syllabi for courses on topics spanning data-driven journalism, computational journalism, data visualization, and other methods. We combined that with a series of in-depth interviews with more than 50 professors and professional journalists (many of whom are adjuncts), and we spoke with ten students or recent graduates. We also attended nine classes and participated in three massive open online courses (MOOCs).

For years, anecdotal evidence has indicated that U.S. journalism schools have fallen behind in data instruction, or rather, started from behind and have not caught up with the field as it has been practiced in newsrooms. A key tenet of this field is that using data to report and tell stories can result in a more powerful story. As LaFleur described it in her IRE article: “understand the data, interview the data, report the data.” That is the process we tried to follow for this report.

We first collected the course offerings of 113 programs accredited (fully or provisionally) by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications. Accreditation is a voluntary process for journalism schools. We used the ACEJMC programs simply because they represented a significant portion of journalism schools and their curriculum requirements include two that fit in with the concept of providing data journalism instruction: “apply basic numerical and statistical concepts” and “apply current tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work, and to understand the digital world.”

We scraped what we could from the journalism program websites and hand-entered the remainder. To verify the data, we then emailed or called programs that had listed either no classes in data journalism or very few classes. This yielded changes in our numbers for several programs where the online course descriptions were not accurate. In soliciting this feedback, we also heard from 11 schools where the department is revamping its curriculum and considering adding data journalism. Sixteen schools did not respond to multiple emails or phone calls. We then revisited every program website for all 113 programs and double-checked the data.1

We also collected information on multimedia offerings of each program so that we could compare multimedia course offerings with data journalism course offerings.

## Our Findings

A little more than half of the universities we reviewed—59 of the 113 schools—offer one or more data journalism courses. We defined a data journalism class as being focused on the intersection of data and journalism, and using spreadsheets, statistical software, relational databases, or programming toward that end. We included in the data journalism category only those programming classes that went beyond basic HTML and CSS. For the purposes of this report, we considered classes on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be focused on digital/design journalism, not data journalism. We also excluded courses in numeracy and communications research methodologies and statistics unless the course offerings explicitly included a journalism focus. The appendix includes tables detailing the full results of our analysis.

For Aaron Williams, who is four years out of college, it was not surprising to hear that our analysis showed 54 of the 113 programs don’t offer a standalone class on data journalism. Williams has worked in data journalism at the Los Angeles Times, the Center for Investigative Reporting, and now as interactive editor at the San Francisco Chronicle. Almost everything he knows he learned from colleagues at NICAR, he said. “I didn’t even really know about data journalism as a discipline, nor did my instructors . . . until basically I was a senior,” Williams recalled.

Of the 59 programs we identified that teach at least one data journalism class, 27 of the schools offer just one course, usually foundational. Fourteen offer two classes. Just 18 of the 59 schools teaching data journalism offer three or more classes in this subject.

At a minimum, these programs offer courses that teach students to use spreadsheets to analyze data for journalistic purposes. At the other end of the spectrum, some schools provide far more, teaching multiple classes in programming skills, such as scraping the Web, building news apps, or creating advanced data visualizations. But programs with multiple classes are rare.

A significant number of programs offer some instruction in data journalism, even if they don’t provide a standalone class. Of the 113 ACEJMC-accredited programs, 69 integrate some data journalism into other reporting and writing courses, our analysis showed. In most cases, this entails introducing the concepts of using spreadsheets or basic analysis as part of reporting and writing classes or certain topic classes, such as business journalism.

Again, tables summarizing these findings can be found in the appendix, while the remainder of this chapter will dig deeper into our analysis of syllabi and course offerings in data journalism.

## Teaching Data Fundamentals: Rows and Columns

Data journalism professors say that the foundational data class is the most important because it lays down key mindsets and skills that are a prerequisite for more advanced learning. Steve Doig of ASU believes the core data syllabus should consist of negotiating for data, thinking critically about data, and using spreadsheets to analyze data.

It is difficult to overstate the value of spreadsheets for managing information. When we asked former CUNY professor Amanda Hickman, now an Open Lab senior fellow at BuzzFeed, how she defines data, she replied, “anything tabular.”

For the foundational computer-assisted reporting classes, the syllabus analysis and interviews indicate that the coursework is comprehensive, providing a strong base in critical thinking and basic concepts surrounding the use of data to find and tell stories. Students are taught similar concepts: critical thinking and developing a “data frame of mind”—in other words, being able to question data in a disciplined way, make sense of discrepancies, and find the underlying patterns and outliers that are important to the analysis.

Most of the classes include some type of hands-on learning. Many of them focus first on spreadsheets, then SQL, followed by mapping and statistical concepts. Others include basic data visualization, using Tableau or Google Fusion as a way into the subject. Multiple professors said the hands-on approach reinforces the critical thinking concepts, including helping students to understand what structured data look like and how information of any kind can be structured for better understanding.

Another key feature of the 63 syllabi we reviewed was an exercise in requesting and negotiating for data from a governmental body. Dan Keating, who works at the Washington Post and teaches a long-standing class in computer-assisted reporting at the University of Maryland, said that finding what “no one has ever known before” is a defining part of his class.

#### Many CAR courses break down this way:

#### Hard Skills
*   Searching for and finding documents and data that enable the journalist to make statements of fact, including public requests, deep research, and scraping skills
*   Understanding data structures and how to clean and standardize data into a form that is useful
*   Analyzing data using spreadsheets, databases, mapping, and visualization
*   Learning advanced statistical methods that illuminate data

#### Guiding concepts
*   Finding what “no one has known before”
*   Developing data-driven storytelling techniques, including how to use numbers effectively in prose and how to tell a story visually
*   Thinking of data as an asset in the reporting process

Whether following the guiding concepts or applying the hard skills, journalism students today must be well grounded in both the importance of data and the tools to use data in storytelling. “If you don’t deal with data as a journalist, you’re shutting yourself down,” said McGinty of the Wall Street Journal.

## Teaching Advanced Data Skills: Visualization and Programming

Advanced instruction in data journalism today is limited. Only 14 of the 113 AEJMC-accredited programs surveyed for this study teach programming beyond HTML/CSS to journalism students. And only 11 of the 113 offer coursework in emerging areas of data journalism, such as drones, virtual reality, and computational methods.

In fact, based on the analysis of syllabi and journalism programs, even some classes described as advanced primarily teach basic tenets of spreadsheet use. Part of the reason is that this is still where the need is greatest, said professors and trainers. “It is unbelievable how much time I spend teaching the basics,” said Jaimi Dowdell, the senior training director for IRE.

However, teaching the basic CAR curriculum is not enough, argued Kevin Quealy, a graphics editor at the New York Times and adjunct professor of journalism at New York University. “To do data work at a high level, one or two semesters of courses is very inadequate,” he said.

Many journalism programs offer design classes, but often those classes focus on basic design tenets, overall web design, or static infographics. Teaching students the concepts and skills needed to visualize data in an interactive way or to build a web application is more rare.

Not all data journalism educators are convinced that data visualization for news presentation should even be considered part of a data journalism curriculum. However, most agree that it is vital to teach visualization for the purpose of analysis. Alberto Cairo, who is leading an effort to fill a data visualization gap in his role as Knight Chair in Visual Journalism at Miami University, believes that even basic visualization instruction goes a long way toward literacy.

First, data journalists need to know how to do basic exploratory visual analysis, Cairo said. And second, even journalists who practice data visualization need to start with the exploratory analysis. They need to know—just like the CAR specialists—how to “interview” the data, he said.

One challenge for traditional journalism schools, which may lack a strong journalism design component and may already have difficulty teaching a CAR or data analysis class, is whether they should tap professionals or recruit or train faculty to incorporate data visualization. To that, Cairo and other academics and professionals we interviewed suggest that such schools collaborate with other parts of a university to fill the gap.

For our analysis, we differentiated between web and digital technologies aimed at presentation and the data skills needed to tell a story. This can be a difficult boundary line. News applications, for example, are focused on design, but, based on our interviews, there is a key difference in building a new website or a multimedia presentation and building something like ProPublica’s “Dollars for Docs,” which enabled readers to drill into the story of pharmaceutical industry payments to doctors and also made it possible for other journalists to find and tell other stories. Meanwhile, “Snow Fall,” the New York Times’s much-touted (and Pulitzer Prize-winning) interactive story of skiers caught in a Washington state avalanche, wasn’t about data and it wasn’t about furthering the use of the data; it used design skills to make the story an immersive multimedia experience for the reader.

Just 14 journalism schools in our data set teach programming beyond HTML and CSS, based on their course descriptions. At present, the programming languages most often used in classes on data-driven reporting are SQL, Python, and R. Instructors focusing on data analysis often incorporate SQL, and some will introduce R. Some instructors also teach web frameworks, such as Django and Ruby on Rails, and some visualization professors teach JavaScript and other skills, though fewer go into the D3 library developed by Mike Bostock, a former New York Times graphic editor.

Deen Freelon, a communication studies professor at American University, takes a different approach, teaching “code for the purposes of analysis” in a course open to both communications and journalism students. “I just got back from my last class where I was teaching students how to analyze Twitter data,” he said.

While advanced classes are rare, there is a clear demand for this knowledge. In the tech world, short programs designed to train web developers have emerged as financially viable businesses. These code schools have shown that some of these skills can be taught in considerably less time than a four-year degree. The Lede Program at Columbia, which offers a summer boot camp as well as an intensive two-semester certification program in computational skills for journalists, has drawn students interested in gaining key data skills in a short period of time.

Maggie Mulvihill, a clinical professor of journalism at Boston University, is raising revenue for computational journalism efforts there through holding week-long camps on storytelling with data for non-journalism professionals.

Integrating data journalism exposes students to the field, highlighting this as an area that they might choose to practice, but it is also an important step for students developing a foundation of journalistic skills. As noted, 69 of the 113 AEJMC-accredited programs already integrate some data journalism into reporting and writing courses, and on this front there is some good news: several schools expressed interest in adding data journalism in a systematic way to their programs. When, in order to verify or data, we contacted each of the programs that had listed either no data journalism class or just one, 11 responded that they are actively working to add data journalism to their curricula. At the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, for example, the school does not offer a standalone CAR class, but it now includes components of data analysis instruction in three separate journalism classes.

## Alternative Data Journalism Instruction: The State of Online Courses

One response to the widespread lack of instruction in data journalism, and instructors capable of teaching it, has been to enlist respected teachers for massive open online courses, or MOOCs. Doig is one of those teachers, and he suggests MOOCs offer great benefit for certain classes, providing expert instruction and hands-on training.

He was an instructor in two MOOCs focused on data journalism, one organized by the European Journalism Centre, which drew 25,000 people to enroll, and the other by Rosental Alves of the Knight Center for Journalism in The Americas at the University of Texas School of Journalism, which drew more than 4,000.

“One strength is that there are a wide variety of MOOCs out there created by top faculty at major institutions like Harvard and MIT and Stanford,” Doig wrote in a memo on the subject. “Their existence begs the question of why should your institution go to the trouble of creating and staffing a class that covers the same ground. (Of course, one reason would be to collect the tuition from your students!)”

He suggested that a partial journalism curriculum could be crafted out of MOOC offerings combined with video content from journalism-related sources such as IRE and the Poynter Institute’s News University. However, being unable to provide individual feedback, MOOCs would come up short for classes in newswriting or basic reporting, he said.

Our research assistant participated in three MOOCs to help us develop a sense of how well the virtual courses teach data journalism. He found that MOOCs are best at offering introductory exposure, but one should not expect to reach in-depth knowledge. MOOCs may be useful for developing an initial foundation in a subject, or for reinforcing a fading proficiency, but may be lacking in terms of teaching reporting techniques, critical thinking, or creative skills. The three MOOCs he participated in were effective at teaching tools, and our RA reported that he was often excited to learn a feature or technique within an application. However, finding ways to apply these tools outside of exercises may require person-to-person interaction in a classroom setting.

In order for MOOCs to be viable resources, they must be maintained. Many classes referenced lost and outdated information. Broken links, missing materials, and redesigned websites often made it difficult to navigate through the lessons.

Our participant’s experience pointed to the issues raised by Doig, but the ASU professor does think MOOCs could still be an optional resource for a data journalism course. “Students eager to go beyond what is offered in the classroom (alas, almost certainly a minority) can be pointed to online sources that will give them that content,” Doig wrote. “To that end, it might be a good idea to develop a list of MOOCs and such that journalism instructors could sample and offer to their students.”

## Textbooks: Little Consensus

Our analysis also found one more gap in curricula—a strong core of textbooks. The concepts and skills of this field were described in fairly consistent ways throughout our interviews and the text of the syllabi, but data journalism instructors share only a few core books in common. In fact, most didn’t use a textbook at all but provided a list of selected readings.

Of the syllabi, more than 70 different textbooks were required, but there was no consensus on which books were preferred. The most popular book—Brant Houston’s Computer-Assisted Reporting: A Practical Guide—was required in just 14 percent of the classes.

Five courses required membership in IRE, and 23 of the courses required students to buy a book published through IRE. They included various editions of Houston’s and IRE’s The Investigative Reporter’s Handbook: A Guide to Documents, Databases, and Techniques and Sarah Cohen’s Numbers in the Newsroom: Using Math and Statistics in News. Various editions of Philip Meyer’s book, New Precision Journalism or Precision Journalism, were required in nine of the courses.

Eight of the courses required The Data Journalism Handbook, which was produced as a combined effort by data journalists around the globe. The online book is an initiative of the European Journalism Centre and the Open Knowledge Foundation and is available free on the Web in English, Russian, Spanish, French, and Georgian.

In 17 classes, no text was required. The lesson here may be that online reading works best for these classes. But it also could mean that despite its long history, data journalism is still a nascent subject within journalism schools and there may be a dearth of effective textbooks beyond the few that are commonly assigned.
